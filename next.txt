Priority 1: Robust Error & Concurrency Handling

Enhance try/catch blocks (especially in async loops and fetches).
Use cancellation tokens/AbortController to avoid race conditions.
Priority 2: Performance & Caching

Leverage memoization (or SWR) in client data fetching to reduce redundant network calls.
Cache blob responses more aggressively to avoid repeated list/fetch cycles.
Priority 3: Code Organization & Reusability

Extract common logic (blob fetching, caching, error logging) into shared utilities.
Simplify complex useEffects in EntityGraph with custom hooks.
Priority 4: UI & Animation Optimization

Optimize heavy state updates in EntityGraph and MouseTrail (consider refs to reduce re-renders).
Improve accessibility (aria labels, focus management) on interactive components.
Priority 5: Environment & Security

Ensure environment variables and tokens are validated and securely managed.
