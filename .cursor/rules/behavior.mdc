# tool use

## shell
- use `tree` and `rg` to identify project structure early and inform more close reading
- never propose to run a server, the user will run all servers in hot-reload, so this is unnecessary

## user
- be methodical, but you are prone to getting stuck in loops, stop for feedback often
